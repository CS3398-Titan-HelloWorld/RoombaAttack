The main project for the semester: A game built in Godot that is a 2D, maze-like, Pac-Man-like Game.

How to Run:

Option 1: 
         
         1.) Install Godot from: https://godotengine.org/download/windows (select the tab for which OS you're running)
             NOTE: we've been using MAC OS and Windows for our project -- both of those have been confirmed to work.

Option 2:
