# RoombaAttack
The main project for the semester: A game built in Godot that is a 2D, maze-like, Pac-Man-like Game.

How to Run:

Download or Clone our project (From the development branch (to see current work) or main (for the most recent 'stable' build).

Option 1: 
         
         1.) Install Godot from: https://godotengine.org/download/windows (select the tab for which OS you're running)
             NOTE: we've been using MAC OS and Windows for our project -- both of those have been confirmed to work.

         2.) Once installed, run the Godot.exe
         3.) When Godot opens, select "Import project" or "Import"
         4.) Navigate to where our project has been downloaded (and unzipped if necessary), then select the "project.godot" file.
         5.) Once the project has loaded, you can press the "Play button" at the top of the Godot Window to run the project.
         
Option 2:
         
         1.) In the location that the project has been downloaded, run the .exe file of the game -- should be the most recent, "stable" build.

Sprint 3(for last assignment : --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Completed Tasks:
                  1.) I added a sound effect for when the player eats/gets to the cookie. I also added the background soundtrack and sound                       for collision with the roomba(however the collision detection did not work so this sound did not play). The work I                         did is included in the EndPosition.tscn and EndPosition.gd. Some of these aditions also went into the main.gd and                           main.tscn. Lastly, I added code to the Player.tscn and Player.gd. All of these edits and changes were pushed to the                         Audio branch. --Ramsey
